# The Mozart Programming Language Compiler

### Why?

Just for fun.

The language does not pretend for anything more than giving me experience of a compiler development.

### Origin of name
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozart_and_scatology

### Concerns:
- c++ runtime types(polymorph) dont like
- backtracking recursive algo for parser may be slow(not the most efficient)

### Dependencies:
- `nlohmann/json`
- `magic_enum.hpp`
